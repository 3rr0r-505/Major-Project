## Project Overview
<img align="right" alt="HoneyPott3r Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3rr0r-505/HoneyPott3r/main/img/HoneyPott3r-noBG-hex1.png" width="250">
<p align="left">
<b>HoneyPott3r</b> is a Python-based honeypot vulnerability scanner designed to simulate various network services to attract, detect, and log unauthorized access attempts. By integrating with popular cybersecurity tools like <b>Nmap, Metasploit, OpenVAS, and Nikto</b>; HoneyPott3r enhances its ability to identify vulnerabilities across multiple protocols and services, providing comprehensive threat detection and analysis. The tool not only identifies common attack vectors but also integrates various detection mechanisms to identify malicious behavior in real-time. This makes it a powerful tool for cybersecurity research, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment.

## Approach for Development

- [ ] **Identify Flaws in Current Honeypots**  
  Conduct research on existing open-source honeypots to pinpoint their limitations and vulnerabilities.

- [ ] **Discover Attack Vectors**  
  Explore how malicious actors exploit these flaws to compromise systems.

- [ ] **Select an Open-Source Honeypot**  
  Choose a suitable open-source honeypot project as the base for further development.

- [ ] **Mitigate Flaws**  
  Implement features and improvements to address the identified weaknesses, enhancing security and functionality.

- [ ] **Documentation and Research Publication**  
  Document all findings, development steps, and results. Compile this work into a research paper and publish it to contribute to the cybersecurity community.
